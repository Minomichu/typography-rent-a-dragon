# Typography and design

A pre-decided black-and-white layout drawn on paper including different sizes and positions for images were to be transferred to the web.

The website had to follow the layout and be responsive, adding ones own choice of what company it should represent, typography, image content, colors and similar. This was my first “animation” and even though I didn’t draw the dragon myself (I’m not an artist) I’m still quite proud of how good of a job it does flying over the screen ☺
